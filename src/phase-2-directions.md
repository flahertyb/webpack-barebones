Now they want tiles, not a table.

A new api endpoint is available for the author information: '/author/:id'

## Requirements:

implement the new mock

- 3 tiles per row please
- product says you can punt on sorting for the initial release
- on click, a tile "flips over" and its content changes to show the author of the book
- if need be, in the tile, show a "..." while you load the author
